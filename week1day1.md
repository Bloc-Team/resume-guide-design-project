# What is a resume?

## Monday - Day 1

### Portfolio
This internship is not going to be a passive experience. You are going to draw, and think, and write and **CREATE** and we need somewhere to store your work. As you
move through the exercises over the coming weeks you can store what you create in one place - a portfolio. We are going to create a portfolio using google sites because
it is simple and it should be relatively simple to navigate between other google tools and site. Please [click this link](https://sites.google.com/new) and create a portfolio
