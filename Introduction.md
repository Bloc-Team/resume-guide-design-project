# Who we are
Bloc is a software technology company that builds data infrastructure for workforce non-profits. We build tools that help program administrators manage student relationships and progress. We also develop curriculum that helps upskill students preparing to transition into work and tools that help students develop in their career like a resume guide and a resume template. We consider ourselves middle skill training providers given we help young adults transition into careers that require specific training, more than high school but less than a 4-year degree.

# Challenge Objective
Design an interface for a tool that would assist students in writing descriptions for their work experience. As a team we really like the [Princeton Resume Guide](https://careerdevelopment.princeton.edu/sites/careerdevelopment/files/resume_guide_2020.pdf) and would like to integrate this tool into our platform. We need to design a user interaction flow and process that would enable students to iteratively build out the experience portions of their resume and store that information in their profile.

We currently have a [deployed version](https://www.bloc.work/guides/1) of the guide application and would like to improve the design and functionality of the application.

Employers often spend only 15-30 seconds scanning a resume, so it must work hard to quickly communicate your skills and value. Think of it as a marketing tool that shows that your product (you) meets the needs of your potential customer (the employer).

A resume is a succinct outline of your education, experience, activities, accomplishments and skills as they pertain to your career goals. Effective resumes get noticed because they:

- Emphasize relevant accomplishments and potential contributions
- Focus on the skills and requirements of a specific field or position
- Are concise, well-organized and easy to read 

# What will you build or **design**
You will practice design thinking and prototyping in this internship program. You will walk away from this program with a portfolio and a body of work. We are only going to focus
on one project but you will think about the project in many different ways. 

We are going to explore a lot of the resources from the Stanford school of design (d-school) and you can start by watching this lesson on design thining to get
a high level understanding of what design thinking is and how this might apply to your project.
