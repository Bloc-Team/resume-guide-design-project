# Documentation - Adding work to your portfolio

#### Hour # 1
How do we add our work from this week to our portfolio
Examine our document collection process - has it been working?
Accountability loop - have you been communicating with anyone WRT - this project? Who should that person be moving forward?

#### Hour # 2
Create a deck of problems this project should solve - no solutions needed
Select one of those problems - and create a wireframe of a solution - a quick drawing
Demo this wireframe to one other student and write down their feedback

##### Hour # 3
Improve the demo and work with 4 other student, find the students you are going to demo to, could easily be other cohort mates
15 minute - demo of problem and proposed solution (4x) [collect feedback]
Aggregate feedback in a user experience folder or document - this could include images, screenshots, whatever you have - you will come back to this next week
